 * Rust will sometimes join two BasicBlocks where a local is live in one and dead in the other.

 * This is not an issue in the MIR since it generally has a
 * [`mir::StatementKind::StorageDead`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/enum.StatementKind.html#variant.StorageDead)

 * is a no-op if the local is already (conditionally) dead.
 * 
 * This Op only appears for edges between basic blocks. It is often emitted for edges to panic
 * handling blocks, but can also appear in regular code for example in the MIR of
 * [this function](https://github.com/dtolnay/syn/blob/3da56a712abf7933b91954dbfb5708b452f88504/src/attr.rs#L623-L628).
